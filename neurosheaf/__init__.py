"""Neurosheaf: Persistent Sheaf Laplacians for Neural Network Similarity Analysis

This package provides a mathematically principled framework for analyzing neural
network similarity using persistent sheaf Laplacians. It includes:

- Debiased CKA computation without double-centering
- Automatic architecture analysis via FX-based poset extraction
- Robust spectral analysis with subspace tracking
- Memory-efficient sparse operations
- Interactive visualization with log-scale support

Key Features:
- 500Ã— memory reduction compared to baseline implementations
- Works with any PyTorch model architecture
- Handles eigenvalue crossings robustly
- Production-ready with comprehensive testing
