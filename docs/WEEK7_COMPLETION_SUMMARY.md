## 🎯 Implementation Overview

Week 7 successfully implemented the sparse sheaf Laplacian assembly and optimization components, completing Phase 3 of the neurosheaf project. The implementation provides efficient, mathematically exact Laplacian construction from whitened sheaf data with GPU optimization and memory efficiency.

## 📦 Delivered Components

### 1. **SheafLaplacianBuilder** (`neurosheaf/sheaf/laplacian.py`)
- **Purpose**: Construct sparse Laplacian Δ = δ^T δ from whitened sheaf data
- **Key Features**:
  - Memory-efficient sparse matrix assembly using COO → CSR conversion
  - Handles variable whitened dimensions (r_v instead of fixed n)
  - GPU-compatible torch.sparse tensor support
  - Mathematical property validation (symmetry, PSD)
  - Edge position caching for filtration support

```python
# Usage example
builder = SheafLaplacianBuilder(enable_gpu=True, memory_efficient=True)
laplacian, metadata = builder.build_laplacian(sheaf)
# Result: scipy.sparse.csr_matrix with exact mathematical properties
```

### 2. **StaticMaskedLaplacian** (`neurosheaf/spectral/static_laplacian.py`)
- **Purpose**: Efficient edge masking for threshold-based filtration
- **Key Features**:
  - Static Laplacian with Boolean masking (no matrix reconstruction)
  - Multiple threshold generation strategies (uniform, quantile, adaptive)
  - GPU/CPU consistent masking operations
  - Memory usage monitoring and optimization
  - Filtration sequence computation

```python
# Usage example
static_laplacian = create_static_masked_laplacian(sheaf, enable_gpu=True)
thresholds = static_laplacian.suggest_thresholds(20, 'adaptive')
sequence = static_laplacian.compute_filtration_sequence(thresholds)
# Result: List of filtered Laplacians for persistence analysis
```

### 3. **Enhanced SheafBuilder** (`neurosheaf/sheaf/construction.py`)
- **New Methods**:
  - `build_laplacian()`: Direct Laplacian construction from sheaf
  - `build_static_masked_laplacian()`: Static Laplacian for filtration
- **Integration**: Seamless pipeline from sheaf → Laplacian → filtration

### 4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**

- **Integration Tests** (`tests/phase3_sheaf/integration/test_week7_integration.py`): End-to-end pipeline
- **Performance Validation** (`benchmarks/week7_performance_validation.py`): Production readiness
